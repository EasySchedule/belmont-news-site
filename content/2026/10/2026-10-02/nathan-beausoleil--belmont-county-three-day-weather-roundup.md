*Headline and deck as they print. The reporter's text follows unchanged.*

**Headline:** Belmont County gets one last shot at rain tonight, then a dry, sunny
weekend and a hard Monday night freeze, with the National Weather Service's Pittsburgh
office calling for a 30 percent shower chance tonight before skies clear Saturday.

---

**Before the three days begin, right now:** it is Friday night, October 2, and this is
the current forecast period — a chance of rain showers before 8 p.m., then mostly
cloudy, a low around 48 °F, north wind 5 to 8 mph. This is the only precipitation in the
entire window, so it is the one thing a reader needs to act on today.

## Three-day table

Point of record: St. Clairsville, Ohio (40.1006, -80.8501). All values are straight
from the National Weather Service gridpoint forecast, in Fahrenheit and miles per hour.
Each row is one calendar day; the low, overnight sky, night wind and night
precipitation chance follow the daytime values in the same cell.

| Date | High | Low | Sky condition | Wind (speed / direction) | Precipitation chance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sat Oct 3, 2026 | 69 °F | 53 °F | Sunny; partly cloudy overnight | 6 to 9 mph NE (day), 1 to 6 mph NE (night) | 0% day, 0% night |
| Sun Oct 4, 2026 | 73 °F | 50 °F | Partly sunny; partly cloudy overnight | 0 to 3 mph S (day), 5 mph W (night) | 6% day, 3% night |
| Mon Oct 5, 2026 | 67 °F | 41 °F | Sunny; clear overnight | 5 to 9 mph NW (day), 2 to 8 mph N (night) | 0% day, 0% night |

The table covers Saturday, October 3 through Monday, October 5. Friday, October 2 is
reported above rather than in the table because at the time of retrieval the API's
current period was already Friday's overnight period, so no daytime high is available
for it.

## Day-by-day roundup

### Friday, October 2 (tonight, current period — the lead-in)

The National Weather Service Pittsburgh office still carries a chance of rain showers
before 8 p.m. across the county, and that is the only precipitation in the entire
three-day window. After the shower chance runs out, the sky turns mostly cloudy and
the temperature falls to a low around 48 °F. The wind is out of the north at 5 to
8 mph. The API's structured precipitation field for this period reads 33 percent; the
period's own narrative text states 30 percent. Both figures appear in the source
response and they are reported here rather than silently reconciled — see the
attribution note at the foot of this document.

**What to do about it:** If you have outdoor plans, a dog walk, or a basketball game
to finish up tonight, take a jacket and a rain shower with you before 8 p.m. and do
not bother planning around anything after that. The rest of tonight is dry.

### Saturday, October 3

Saturday is the clean day of the weekend. The forecast calls for sunny skies and a
high near 69 °F, with a northeast wind at 6 to 9 mph. Saturday night eases back to
partly cloudy with a low around 53 °F and a lighter northeast wind of 1 to 6 mph. The
precipitation chance is zero percent for both Saturday and Saturday night, so this is
a good day to be outside and a reasonable night to leave the car uncovered.

### Sunday, October 4

Sunday is the warmest day of the roundup and the only one with any measurable
precipitation risk. The forecast calls for partly sunny skies and a high near 73 °F,
with a light south wind at 0 to 3 mph. The precipitation chance peaks at 6 percent
during the day and drops to 3 percent Sunday night, with a low around 50 °F and a west
wind around 5 mph. Six percent is a trace at best — not a rain forecast for Belmont
County, and no umbrella required.

### Monday, October 5

Monday is dry, sunny, and the coldest night of the window. The forecast calls for a
high near 67 °F with a northwest wind at 5 to 9 mph. After sunset the sky clears and
the temperature falls to a low around 41 °F on a north wind at 2 to 8 mph. That 41 °F
low is the number to watch. It is the first hard overnight freeze of the season's
first cold push and it will catch anything left out. The precipitation chance is zero
percent for both Monday and Monday night.

## Multi-source comparison

The morning edition requires a multi-source roundup, so the National Weather Service
gridpoint values above are checked against two further named sources. Neither of these
is the endpoint of record; both are used for cross-checking only.

**Source 1 — Open-Meteo**, retrieved 2026-10-02.
Endpoint: `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast` for latitude 40.1006, longitude
-80.8501, requesting daily maximum and minimum temperature in Fahrenheit, maximum
precipitation probability in percent, and maximum 10-metre wind speed in miles per
hour, with timezone `America/New_York`. Open-Meteo returned a high of 73.0 °F and a
low of 55.9 °F for Friday, October 2, a high of 67.5 °F and a low of 49.8 °F for
Saturday, October 3, a high of 69.9 °F and a low of 53.5 °F for Sunday, October 4, and
a high of 63.6 °F and a low of 44.0 °F for Monday, October 5. Open-Meteo's
precipitation probabilities were 50 percent for Friday, 1 percent for Saturday, 5
percent for Sunday, and 0 percent for Monday.

**Source 2 — National Weather Service Zone Forecast Product (ZFP) issued by the
Pittsburgh office, `FPUS51 KPBZ 022102`**, retrieved 2026-10-02, via endpoint
`https://api.weather.gov/products/types/ZFP/locations/PBZ` and the product's own
endpoint at `https://api.weather.gov/products/{id}`. The ZFP is a hand-written NWS
product covering zone OHZ059 in narrative form rather than gridpoint numbers. Its
OHZ059 segment reads: tonight, "Considerable cloudiness with a chance of showers this
evening, then partly cloudy after midnight. Lows in the upper 40s. North winds 5 to
10 mph with gusts up to 20 mph. Chance of rain 40 percent." Saturday: "Mostly sunny.
Highs in the upper 60s. Northeast winds 5 to 10 mph." Saturday night: "Clear in the
evening, then becoming mostly cloudy. Mild. Lows in the lower 50s. East winds around
5 mph." Sunday: "Mostly cloudy in the morning, then becoming partly sunny. Highs in
the lower 70s. Southeast winds around 5 mph, becoming southwest in the afternoon."
Sunday night: "Mainly clear. Lows around 50. Northwest winds around 5 mph." Monday:
"Mostly sunny. Highs in the mid 60s." Monday night: "Clear. Lows in the lower 40s."

### Where the sources disagree

There are two real disagreements, and neither is averaged away.

**Disagreement 1 — tonight's precipitation chance.** The NWS gridpoint forecast's
structured field says 33 percent for the Friday night period. The narrative text in
that same gridpoint period says "Chance of precipitation is 30 percent." The NWS Zone
Forecast Product for OHZ059 says "Chance of rain 40 percent." Open-Meteo says 50
percent. That is a spread of 20 percentage points across four retrievals of the same
evening.

*Which one Belmont News is publishing and why:* **30 percent**, the narrative figure
stated inside the gridpoint forecast period itself, because that is the same endpoint
of record that supplies every other number in the table and it is the number a reader
will hear re-read to them. The 33 percent structured field is in the same JSON
document a few lines away, and the discrepancy is carried forward to the morning desk
rather than hidden — the three values are all quoted here so a reader can see the
spread. The operational point is unchanged across all of them: this is a chance of
showers before 8 p.m., not a soaking rain, and no source in this roundup puts
Belmont County above a 50 percent chance of rain for the evening. The higher figures
from Open-Meteo and the ZFP are model-side, not official.

**Disagreement 2 — Sunday's high.** The NWS gridpoint forecast says 73 °F. The NWS
Zone Forecast Product for OHZ059 says "Highs in the lower 70s," which is consistent
with 73 °F. Open-Meteo says 69.9 °F, roughly three degrees cooler.

*Which one Belmont News is publishing and why:* **73 °F**, the gridpoint number,
because it is the endpoint of record for this desk and the hand-written NWS zone
product does not contradict it. Open-Meteo is a different numerical model run and runs
cooler than the NWS on each of the three days in the table — 67.5 against 69 on
Saturday, 69.9 against 73 on Sunday, 63.6 against 67 on Monday, an offset of about
1.5 to 3.4 degrees in the same direction every day. A consistent offset across all
three days reads as a model bias difference rather than a
disagreement about this specific weekend's weather, so it does not displace the NWS
figure. The 73 °F figure is published with the Sunday wind note intact, because the
gridpoint and the zone product disagree on wind direction for Sunday — the gridpoint
says south, the zone product says southeast becoming southwest — and both are stated
above rather than one being chosen silently.

**A note on what could not be checked.** A third cross-check was attempted against the
Norwegian Meteorological Institute's public location forecast service at
`https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/compact`. That endpoint returned
HTTP 403 to this newsroom on 2026-10-02 and could not be retrieved. It is not cited as
a source because no data was obtained from it. The two sources above are the two that
answered.

## What to do about it

- **Tonight (30 percent chance of showers before 8 p.m.):** carry a jacket. After
  8 p.m. it is dry and you can drop the umbrella.
- **Saturday (0 percent):** the best outdoor day of the weekend. No weather action needed.
- **Sunday (6 percent):** a trace at most. No action needed.
- **Monday night (low around 41 °F):** bring in anything outside that water does not
  kill, and cover the garden if you have not already. This is the coldest reading in
  the three-day window by nine degrees, and it arrives under a clear sky, so there
  will be no wind to blunt the cold.

## Active alerts for OHZ059

**No watch, warning, or advisory is active for forecast zone OHZ059 as of retrieval.**

This was checked against the **NWS Active Alerts API for the zone** at
`https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active?zone=OHZ059`, retrieved 2026-10-02. The response
returned a feature count of zero. As a second check on the same product, the same
Active Alerts API was queried by point at
`https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active?point=40.1006,-80.8501` and also returned zero
active alerts. There is no severe weather to report for Belmont County in this
roundup, and none is being implied.

Note for readers who are checking this later: an empty alert response is a statement
about the moment of retrieval, not a standing guarantee. Anyone reading after this
roundup is published should re-check the same endpoint.
